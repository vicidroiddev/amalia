# Amalia

Amalia is a painless Android MVP implementation which facilitates separation of concerns and dictates a straightforward uni-directional flow of data between components.

Amalia leverages Android's architecture components to ensure compliance with the lifecycle. Furthermore, Amalia's presenters are backed by ViewModelProvider to ensure seemless restoration during configuration changes.
