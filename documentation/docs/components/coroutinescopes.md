# Coroutine Scopes

- Coroutine support will be provided as part of an external gradle module _amalia-coroutine-scopes_
- Extension oriented design will be used to provide added scopes on `<BasePresenter<*,*>` for main/io/default dispatchers
- Will be tackled with https://github.com/vicidroiddev/amalia/issues/12
